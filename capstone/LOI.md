**Capstone Project Name/Idea**:
_Stake & Win_
![overview](./img/overview.png)
**Brief Project Description**:
_Stake & Win_ is a decentralized platform built on the Solana blockchain that enables users to stake their tokens, earn staking rewards while participating in a lottery simultaneously. Users can choose to compound their staking rewards or withdraw them at any time.

**Reason for Choosing this Project**:
This project aims to gamify traditional staking platforms by offering a more engaging and rewarding experience for users or groups. Combining staking with a lottery system provides users with the potential for higher returns and increased excitement. Additionally, the project leverages Solana's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

**Target Audience**:
Crypto-enthusiasts, particularly those who hold SOL (or meme) tokens, are seeking passive income opportunities, as well as those interested in decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain-based gambling. This includes individuals with varying levels of experience, ranging from beginners to advanced, who seek higher returns on their investments.
**Value Proposition**:
_Stake & Win_ offers a unique value proposition by combining the benefits of staking with the thrill of a lottery. Users can earn competitive staking rewards while simultaneously participating in a weekly draw for a chance to win a significant portion of the collected staking fees.

## Marketing and Distribution

**Social Media**:
Utilize targeted advertising campaigns on platforms like Twitter, Discord, and Telegram to reach crypto communities and influencers.
**Content Marketing**:
Publish informative blog posts, articles, and videos that explain the platform's features, benefits, and how to use it effectively.
